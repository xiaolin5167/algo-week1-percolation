# algo-week1-percolation
Programming Assignment 1: Percolation of Algorithms, Part I at coursera online learning platform.

关于配置algs4.jar: 有很多方法，这里我简单地把它解压到项目目录下使用
课程只需要实现Percolation和PercolationStats两个类。另外两个是用来帮助可视化测试Percolation的，在课程官网有提供。
编译和运行方式如下。

dependency used: algs4.jar (found in dependecy directory)
###to use algs4, I extract it into my project folder, you could use other way as well.

what we are asked to is that implement 2 class：Percolation.java and PercolationStats.java
InteractivePercolationVisualizer.java and PercolationVisualizer.java are used for testing Percolation.java in a visual way. 
Those are provided by testing resourse of course.

Percolation：
 * Compilation:  javac Percolation.java
 Local Test:
 * Execution:    java Percolation ../test/input.txt

PercolationVisualizer：
 * Compilation:  javac Percolation.java
 Local Test:
 * Execution:    java Percolation ../test/wayne98.txt
